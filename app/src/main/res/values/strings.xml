        \n\n1. Your daily goal is initially set as 5,000 steps which can be increased by you.
        \n\n2. For every 1,000 steps taken in a day, you will gain a green leaf.
        \n\n3. When you will fail to meet your daily goal, you will lose the number of leaves that corresponds to the remaining steps required to meet your goal.
        \n\n4. If you will meet your daily goal consistently for a week, you will gain a fruit on your tree.
        \n\n5. But, if you will fail to fulfill your daily goals for a week, you will lose a fruit (if any).</string>
