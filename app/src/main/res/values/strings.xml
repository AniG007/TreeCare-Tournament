    <string name="starter_mode_instructions">This is a single player mode. Here are the rules of this mode:
        \n\n1. Your daily goal is initially set as 5,000 steps which can be increased by you.
        \n\n2. For every 1,000 steps taken in a day, you will gain a green leaf.
        \n\n3. When you will fail to meet your daily goal, you will lose the number of leaves that corresponds to the remaining steps required to meet your goal.
        \n\n4. If you will meet your daily goal consistently for a week, you will gain a fruit on your tree.
        \n\n5. But, if you will fail to fulfill your daily goals for a week, you will lose a fruit (if any).</string>

    <string name="challenger_mode_instructions">This is an individual-based competitive mode with following rules:
        \n\n1. You compete with other player(s). The rules in the Starter Mode also apply to every player in this mode.
        \n\n2. You can see various active challenges (created by other players) and can choose to join any of them to compete.
        \n\n3. Alternatively, you can create your own challenge by inviting other players to compete with you.
        \n\n4. To publicly recognize players’ efforts, there is a leaderboard that ranks top 10 players in descending order of the number of steps they took during challenge.
        \n\n5. Every player participating in a challenge can visualize the state of the other players’ trees.
        \n\n6. Every challenge has a timeline which is set by the organizer.</string>

    <string name ="tournament_mode_instructions">This is a team-based competitive mode:
    \n\n1. You need to be in a team to participate in a tournament
    \n\n2. Only Team Captains can enroll their teams in a tournament but anyone can create a tournament and add teams.
    \n\n3. You can be a part of only one team.
    \n\n4. When you create a team, you\'ll become the team\'s captain. Although, you have an option to transfer the captaincy to someone else at a later stage
    \n\n5. There\'s a leaderboard where teams are ranked according to their total steps taken during the tournament duration
    \n\n6. You can leave a team and join another team but you\'d lose the progress of your current tournaments
    \n\n7. For every *3000* steps you take, you gain a leaf.
